# Deflection Finder for Complete Cantilever Beam

## Overview
The Deflection Finder for Complete Cantilever Beam is a computational tool designed to analyze the bending behavior of a cantilever beam under various loading conditions. It utilizes numerical methods to calculate deflection and provides graphical representations to help engineers and researchers understand the mechanical behavior of the structure.

Cantilever beams are widely used in engineering applications, including bridges, overhanging structures, and mechanical components. This tool helps in predicting the deflection profile, ensuring that the beam design meets structural integrity requirements.

## Features
- Computes deflection for different types of loading conditions, such as point loads, uniformly distributed loads (UDL), and varying loads.
- Implements numerical methods such as the finite difference method and Newton-Raphson iteration for solving non-linear equations.
- Provides visual representations of beam deflection to assist in structural analysis.
- Optimized for accuracy and computational efficiency.
- Open-source and easily customizable for different beam configurations.
